* A GitHub repository which contains your code  along with a `.md` file containing your thought process would be the end product that we are expecting.
*Story:
At first I was unable to find any kind of bug at first but then I realized that it can make it more impressive.

Then I have changed few lines using HTML and CSS (in which I was good enough)

*CHANGE

1.)I have created two divisions to underline two different words of a same line in different colours(Used at RECENT PROJECTS).Then made the display property of the first division to inline.As it would look more attractive.
Then added text-decoration as underlineline and text-decoration-color was also changed accordingly.

2.)I have changed the font colour of "LOVE " to red colour from white colour from the sentence "CODING IS LOVE" since it suits the colours used in the website.It was done five times as it was present in "five projects of the website".

3.)I have also changed the font-size and font-weight of the entire text present since at normal sight it was causing more strain to reader's eyes in order to increase its comfortability i ahve done it.
This was also done for the entire webpage's paragraphs (change in font -size and font-weight)
