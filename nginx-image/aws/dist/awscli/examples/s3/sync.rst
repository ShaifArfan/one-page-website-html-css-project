**Sync from local directory to S3 bucket**

The following ``sync`` command syncs objects to a specified bucket and prefix from files in a local directory by
uploading the local files to s3.  A local file will require uploading if one of the following conditions is true:

* The local file does not exist under the specified bucket and prefix.
* The size of the local file is different than the size of the s3 object.
* The last modified time of the local file is newer than the last modified time of the s3 object.

In this example, the user syncs the bucket ``mybucket`` to the local current directory.  The local current directory 
contains the files ``test.txt`` and ``test2.txt``.  The bucket ``mybucket`` contains no objects::

    aws s3 sync . s3://mybucket

Output::

    upload: test.txt to s3://mybucket/test.txt
    upload: test2.txt to s3://mybucket/test2.txt
    
**Sync from S3 bucket to another S3 bucket**

The following ``sync`` command syncs objects to a specified bucket and prefix from objects in another specified
bucket and prefix by copying s3 objects.  An s3 object will require copying if one of the following conditions is true:

* The s3 object does not exist in the specified bucket and prefix destination.
* The sizes of the two s3 objects differ.
* The last modified time of the source is newer than the last modified time of the destination.

In this example, the user syncs the bucket ``mybucket`` to the bucket ``mybucket2``.  
The bucket ``mybucket`` contains the objects ``test.txt`` and ``test2.txt``.  The bucket
``mybucket2`` contains no objects::

    aws s3 sync s3://mybucket s3://mybucket2

Output::

    copy: s3://mybucket/test.txt to s3://mybucket2/test.txt
    copy: s3://mybucket/test2.txt to s3://mybucket2/test2.txt
    
**Sync from S3 bucket to local directory**

The following ``sync`` command syncs files to a local directory from objects in a specified bucket and prefix by
downloading s3 objects.  An s3 object will require downloading if one of the following conditions is true:

* The s3 object does not exist in the local directory.
* The size of the s3 object differs from the size of the local file. 
* The last modified time of the s3 object is older than the last modified time of the local file.  

Take note that when objects are downloaded from s3, the last modified time of the local file is changed to the last modified time of the s3 object.  
In this example, the user syncs the current local directory to the bucket ``mybucket``.  The bucket ``mybucket`` contains 
the objects ``test.txt`` and ``test2.txt``.  The current local directory has no files::

    aws s3 sync s3://mybucket .

Output::

    download: s3://mybucket/test.txt to test.txt
    download: s3://mybucket/test2.txt to test2.txt
    
**Sync from local directory to S3 bucket while deleting files that exist in the destination but not in the source**

The following ``sync`` command syncs objects to a specified bucket and prefix from files in a local directory by
uploading the local files to s3.  Because the ``--delete`` parameter flag is used, any files existing in
specified bucket and prefix but not existing in the local directory will be deleted.  In this example, the user syncs
the bucket ``mybucket`` to the local current directory.  The local current directory contains the files ``test.txt`` and
``test2.txt``.  The bucket ``mybucket`` contains the object ``test3.txt``::

    aws s3 sync . s3://mybucket --delete

Output::

    upload: test.txt to s3://mybucket/test.txt
    upload: test2.txt to s3://mybucket/test2.txt
    delete: s3://mybucket/test3.txt
    
**Sync from local directory to S3 bucket while excluding files that match a specified pattern**

The following ``sync`` command syncs objects to a specified bucket and prefix from files in a local directory by
uploading the local files to s3.  Because the ``--exclude`` parameter flag is used, all files matching the pattern
existing both in s3 and locally will be excluded from the sync.  In this example, the user syncs the bucket ``mybucket``
to the local current directory.  The local current directory contains the files ``test.jpg`` and ``test2.txt``.  The
bucket ``mybucket`` contains the object ``test.jpg`` of a different size than the local ``test.jpg``::

    aws s3 sync . s3://mybucket --exclude "*.jpg"

Output::

    upload: test2.txt to s3://mybucket/test2.txt
    
**Sync from S3 bucket to local directory while excluding objects that match a specified pattern**

The following ``sync`` command syncs files to a local directory from objects in a specified bucket and prefix by
downloading s3 objects.  This example uses the ``--exclude`` parameter flag to exclude a specified directory
and s3 prefix from the ``sync`` command.  In this example, the user syncs the local current directory to the bucket
``mybucket``.  The local current directory contains the files ``test.txt`` and ``another/test2.txt``.  The bucket
``mybucket`` contains the objects ``another/test5.txt`` and ``test1.txt``::

    aws s3 sync s3://mybucket/ . --exclude "*another/*"

Output::

    download: s3://mybucket/test1.txt to test1.txt
    
**Sync from S3 bucket to another S3 bucket in a different region**

The following ``sync`` command syncs files between two buckets in different regions::

    aws s3 sync s3://my-us-west-2-bucket s3://my-us-east-1-bucket --source-region us-west-2 --region us-east-1


**Sync to an S3 access point**

The following ``sync`` command syncs the current directory to the access point (``myaccesspoint``)::

    aws s3 sync . s3://arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/myaccesspoint/

Output::

    upload: test.txt to s3://arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/myaccesspoint/test.txt
    upload: test2.txt to s3://arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/myaccesspoint/test2.txt
